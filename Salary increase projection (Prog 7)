/**
 * The main() function will prompt the user for 3 different inputs (Salary, Years, AnnRaise) and
 * output a tabular list containing the salary increased by a percent.
 * 
 * a. Declare all variables.
 * b. Display a description of the program.
 * c. Prompt the user for the first variable, "salary".
 * d. Store user input into the variable.
 * e. Start a while loop, with the condition being if cin.fail is true. If entered, cin is cleared, the stream
 *  is ignored, the user is prompted for a valid input, and that input is stored back into the variable.
 * f. Prompt the user for "AnnRaise".
 * g. Repeat step 'e' for "AnnRaise".
 * h. Prompt the user for "Years".
 * i. Repeat step 'e' for "Years".
 * j. Display a string that acts as headers for the tabular list, using escape characters '\n' and '\t'
 *  for formatting.
 * k. Display a string of dashes, acts as a barrier between the header and the information itself.
 * l. Start a for loop, creating a variable 'i', with the condition that i is less than or equal to "Years",
 *  and adding +1 to i with each iteration of the loop. With each iteration, the program will display 
 *  'i', acting as the years in the list, '\t' for formatting, and "Salary", to display the current Salary. After
 * being displayed, "Salary" is set equal to "Salary" added to the percent * the salary before, creating a new salary.
 * This process is repeated until 'i' is greater than "Years".
