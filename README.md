Hi, my name is Aziel Yohannes. I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for anything tech-related.
This portfolio of mine contains many of the programming projects I've ventured through, whether through my school or from my own personal endeavours.
The portfolio is separated into branches, with each branch containing the various projects I've completed, sorted by when it was finished.
