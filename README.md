Hi, my name is Aziel Yohannes. I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for anything tech-related.
This portfolio of mine contains many of the programming projects I've ventured through, whether through my school or from my own personal endeavours.
The portfolio is separated into branches, with each branch containing the various projects I've completed, sorted by date of completion.

Some info about myself:
As I've stated above, I'm a young, aspiring software engineer who wants to learn what I can about coding. I have a passion for learning what's doing on behind the code
and the thought of creating something of my own is what motivates me.
I've only recently started seriously trying to learn, with my start line of code printing "Hello World" all the way back in 2019. I've been off and on with coding, before my first class
opened my eyes to what I was missing. Since then, I've been enamored with the discipline, trying to improve however I can.
My hobbies include anything coding-related, such as watching coding-related content or solving problems, hanging out with friends, playing games, reading, and writing. I also enjoy
daily walks and tour the gym to keep myself in good shape.
