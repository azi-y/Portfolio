Welcome to part of my portfolio, specifically my projects from 2023-2024.
This was the earliest I started coding, with most of the projects listed made at the behest of classes.
Any tips on the code itself, as well as the layout of the portfolio, would be greatly appreciated.
You can contact me through the methods detailed in the main README.
