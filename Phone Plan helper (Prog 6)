/**
 * The main() function will prompt for user input 3 times before returning a specific
 * string based on the user's input.
 * 
 * a. Declare all variables used during the program.
 * b. Display a string detailing the purpose of the program as well as prompt the user for the first input.
 * c. Store user input into "talkMins".
 * d. Start a while loop on the condition that cin fails due to an invalid input. If entered, the cin error is ignored and
 * the user is prompted for a valid input which is then stored back into the variable and reevaluated.
 * e. Repeat steps b-d (excluding the program description) on the variables "textMsgs" and "dataAmt", respectively.
 * f. Start an if statement on the condition that "dataAmt" is greater than or equal to one. If entered, starts another if statement
 * on the condition that "dataAmt" is greater than 2, in which case, the program will display a string recommending them plan F. Otherwise,
 * the program will display plan E.
 * g. If "dataAmt" is less than one, an else if statement checks if "talkMins" is less than 500, in which case, the loop is entered and another if statement is
 * started, on the condition that "textMsgs" is less than 1, at which point, plan A is displayed. If "textMsgs" is greater than 0, plan B is displayed.
 * h. If "talkMins" is greater than or equal to 500, another if statement is started on the condition that "textMsgs" is less than or equal to 100, in which case,
 * plan C is displayed. If "textMsgs" is greater than 100, plan D is displayed.
 * i. The program returns 0.
 * 
 * @param args - None.
 * @return   -   0.
